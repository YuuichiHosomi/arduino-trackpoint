Introduction
============

Arduino library for interfacing with an IBM TrackPoint

For running the Arduino sketch, you need the PS/2 library available on (as of
August 2013):

Needs to be adapted.

Tested with Arduino IDE: 1.0.5

Example
=======

I successfully used the library with a TrackPoint board broken off the keyboard
of my ThinkPad 1161-267 to an Arduino Micro.
